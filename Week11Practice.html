        <h4>Facts About Me!</h4>

        <p>I was born in Manila, Philippines and I moved to the U.S. when I was 4 years old. Stayed in California for majority of my life until my Dad had to move to Texas for work. I much prefer California due to weather as well as having access to Disneyland and Universal Studios at a closer proximity, but Texas is alright.</p>

        <p>Honestly, since my family moved around a lot I've been to so many schools. Sometimes for a couple of years and on occasion just lasting a couple months. Just in Texas alone, I've been to 2 middle schools and 2 high schools. 
            <br>
            <br>
        My hobbies include reading mangas and on occasion novels provided they are interesting and are not too long. I usually read online theses days, but I don't mind going to the library every now and then. I usually watch Youtube videos or watch anime online rather than watching television, but that's more because I'm lazy and don't want to go into the living room and much prefer to stay in my bedroom.</p>

        <p>I plan to be a vido game designer one day. As for what company to work for, it's pretty difficult to say. I do love Square Enix games a lot, so working for that company would be a dream, but that would likely mean I would have to move to Japan. Something I want to incorporate into my studies is foreign languages, including programming ones, since I love to learn about the culture and translations/ localizations comes up pretty often in video games, so it's a pretty hand asset. </p>
